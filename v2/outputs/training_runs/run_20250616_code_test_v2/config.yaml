### Purpose: Simple, quick test to check if model training is working. Used for debugging.
### Added more configurations compared to 20250616_1.yaml such as test and validation splits
settings:
  device: "cpu"  # or "cpu"
  run_desc: "Quick test for model training functionality"
  seed: 42
  test_ratio: 0.1
  val_ratio: 0.2 # 0.2 of training data after test split  = 0.9 * 0.2 = 0.18 of total data
data:
  source: "data/encoded/predictor_encoded_20250613.npy"
  destination_base: "outputs/training_runs/"
hyperparams:
  optimizer: "adam"
  loss_function: "mse"
  epochs: 1
  batch_size: 32
  n_samples: 1000
  learning_rate: 0.001
  dims: 42 # dimenions of the input data (shape[1], default to 42 for predictor)
